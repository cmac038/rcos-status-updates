## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Didn't do too much, was busy studying for tests the past two weeks. Continued researching and familiarizing with Flask, decided we will probably start from scratch instead of using a seed.

## This Week's Plan

> Start building Flask server from scratch to determine how feasible it is.

## Anything Blocking?

> Other time commitments.
